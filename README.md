### Hi ðŸ‘‹

<br/> I'm Lucas, and I like to code in my free time.

Currently, I am working on projects to sharpen my skills in software development, from the early stages to deploying into production, including writing API documentation and following best practices.

Python, Rust, Docker, Nginx, and Kong are among the backend technologies I have gained good experience with.

On the frontend side, I chose to go with TypeScript since I feel more comfortable declaring types.
